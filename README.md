## Inspiration

The medical system in Canada is overloaded, the wait times in the emergency rooms are extremely long. We aim to alleviate the strain on certain hospitals and allowing patients of non life-threatening illnesses to seek treatment in a faster method.

## What it does

It collects data from all those using the app to approximate wait time a new patient would have if he/she would walk in at that exact moment.

## How we built it

We built a React-Native interface where we will be able to simply plug-in our backend code when that will be implemented.

## Challenges we ran into

* Learning React-native
* Navigation with global app state

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We succeeded in building a pretty and clean interface. We were also able to think of the functionalities it would need to be able to crowdsource, like a AWS back end.

## What we learned

* The React-Native framework
* UX can be really difficult

## What's next for MediWait

* Building the backend to have a fully functionning open crowdsourced application.
* use data from [index sante](https://www.indexsante.ca/urgences/)
* Polish the UX and add more features
